# openvpn-install - Documentation - Easy to follow

OpenVPN installer for Debian, Ubuntu

This script will let you setup your own secure VPN server in just a few seconds.

## Usage 

First, get the script and make it executable:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melakhvision/openvpn/main/openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
```

# Default -
To make things easier the default setting are selected when you run the script unless you want to change it and you know what you're doing.

Then run it:
```sh
./openvpn-install.sh
```

You need to run the script as root and have the TUN module enabled.

The first time you run it, you'll have to follow the assistant and answer a few questions to setup your VPN server.

When OpenVPN is installed, you can run the script again, and you will get the choice to:

- Add a client
- Remove a client
- Uninstall OpenVPN

In your home directory, you will have `.ovpn` files. These are the client configuration files. Download them from your server and connect using your favorite OpenVPN client.

### Headless install

It's also possible to run the script headless, e.g. without waiting for user input, in an automated manner.

Example usage:

```bash
AUTO_INSTALL=y ./openvpn-install.sh

# or

export AUTO_INSTALL=y
./openvpn-install.sh
```

A default set of variables will then be set, by passing the need for user input.

If you want to customise your installation, you can export them or specify them on the same line, as shown above.

- `APPROVE_INSTALL=y`
- `APPROVE_IP=y`
- `IPV6_SUPPORT=n`
- `PORT_CHOICE=1`
- `PROTOCOL_CHOICE=1`
- `DNS=1`
- `COMPRESSION_ENABLED=n`
- `CUSTOMIZE_ENC=n`
- `CLIENT=clientname`
- `PASS=1`


Password-protected clients are not supported by the headless installation method since user input is expected by Easy-RSA.

The headless install is more-or-less idempotent, in that it has been made safe to run multiple times with the same parameters, e.g. by a state provisioner like Ansible/Terraform/Salt/Chef/Puppet.
### Headless User Addition

It's also possible to automate the addition of a new user. Here, the key is to provide the (string) value of the `MENU_OPTION` variable along with the remaining mandatory variables before invoking the script.

The following Bash script adds a new user `foo` to an existing OpenVPN configuration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export MENU_OPTION="1"
export CLIENT="foo"
export PASS="1"
./openvpn-install.sh
```

## Features
